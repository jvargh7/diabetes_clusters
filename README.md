## Abstract

Several international studies have stratified people with diabetes into phenotypical clusters. However, there has not been a systematic examination of the variation in these clusters across ethnic groups. For example, some clusters appear more frequent among Asians and may have lower weight, age at diagnosis and poorer beta cell function.
